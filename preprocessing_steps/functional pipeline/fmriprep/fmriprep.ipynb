    "fMRIPrep is a robust and standardized pipeline for preprocessing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. It aims to provide high-quality, reproducible results by combining various tools from the neuroimaging software ecosystem (like FSL, ANTs, FreeSurfer, etc.) and adhering to best practices in fMRI data processing. \n",

    "1) Anatomical Preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "   fMRIPrep starts with preprocessing the anatomical (T1-weighted) images, which provides a reference for aligning the functional data.\n",
    "   Skull-stripping: Removes non-brain tissues from the T1-weighted anatomical image.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Bias field correction: Corrects for intensity inhomogeneities in the anatomical image.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Spatial normalization: The brain is aligned to a standard space (usually MNI152) using non-linear registration techniques (ANTs).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Segmentation: The T1-weighted image is segmented into different tissue classes, such as gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Surface reconstruction (optional): FreeSurfer is used to generate cortical surface reconstructions if requested. This includes the generation of white and pial surfaces.\n",

    "\n",
    "   Slice-timing correction: Accounts for the fact that different slices in the fMRI volumes are acquired at slightly different times.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Motion correction: Corrects for participant head movement across the fMRI acquisition, using motion parameters (rigid-body transformations).\n",

    "   Fieldmap-based distortion correction (optional): If fieldmaps are available, they can be used to correct for spatial distortions caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities.\n",

    "   Co-registration to T1-weighted image: Aligns the functional (fMRI) data to the preprocessed anatomical data using a rigid-body transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Normalization to standard space: The functional data is aligned to the MNI space, leveraging the normalization from the anatomical processing stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Resampling: The functional data can be resampled to different resolutions (e.g., to match the MNI template) based on user specifications.\n",

    "   fMRIPrep extracts various confounds from the data to later be used in statistical models or denoising steps.\n",

    "   Motion parameters: Translations and rotations estimated during motion correction.\n",

    "   Anatomical confounds: Signal from white matter, CSF, and global signal are extracted based on tissue segmentation.\n",
